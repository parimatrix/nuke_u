# MediCoin
### Our main aim is to provide a portal where the stakeholders in the medical sector, including the end users control the data being made available to the society, in an environment which is a fair reflection of one's contributions and reduces the fear of fudged data. The medical data follows a model where the prices of the medical records is controlled by the supply and demand of the data, as well as the quality of the data. Higher demand means higher gains for the contributors.
### A major component of the system is Data Creation. We target specific diseases which provide a chance for technology to take over and reduce the doctor's intervention to provide better services and results to the patients.
### The diseases we target are : Parkinson's Disease ( where we track the hand vibrations to predict the stage of the patient ) and Asperger's Syndrome ( where we identify the smile of a person to track a person's response to different environments )
